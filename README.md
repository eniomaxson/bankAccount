# Introduction

This is a simple project that we're going to use to learn Asp.Net Core Framework using .NET 6 SDK.
Although it's a simple project the concepts applied here once learned it'll be the same in any other Web API project.

# Required tools

For contributing on this project you need to have the .NET 6 SDK installed, and [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/get-started) with C# Dev Kit. 


# What we'll learn here

We're going to explore most of the main features Asp.Net Core framework by implementing a simple project which will cover topics like:

- Application anatomy
- Data binding
- Serialization
- Configuration
- Logging
- Dependency Injection
- Entity Framework Core
- Authentication and Authorization
- Caching  

# What is .NET 6

[.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) is an opensource developer platform, created by Microsoft. By using .NET you will be able to create different kinds of applications that can run in Unix, Windows, and Mac.

# Get started to C#

C# has become the most used language supported by the .NET platform, indeed it's a powerful language and has been envolving alongside with .NET.  

A good kick of point if you're learning C# is consuming this youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oULFjxrOagaERVAMbmG20Xe) published by dotnet Team:

if you preffer to read take a look on the [C# get started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) on the language documentation page. 

I also recommend you take a look at [language code style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names) it's good to follow it.


# Get started with Asp.Net Core

As the .NET is a multi-purpose developer platform, it offers libraries and frameworks for building a lot of different kinds of applications.

For developing Web apps it has the Asp.Net Core Framework, but you should be aware that even with enphases on WEB it defines at least 4 kinds of applications to choose when creating a new web project, MVC Application, Razor Pages, Blazor Apps, and Web API. 

For this Project we're going to use AsP.NET Core for creating REST Web APIs.

If you're the kind of person that learn by reading [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio) you will find a tutorial that you can use to get started exploring the framework.

If you're are the kind of person that learns better by watching I found this [intro playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0KG8OKKgKs&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVjOKgzsWqdFVvzGL2_d72v&index=1&ab_channel=dotnet) published by Microsoft team. Although it's on .NET 5 you can watch and learn how Controllers based APIs works. The main changes from .NET 5 to 6 on Web APIs are the startup class and the minimals API feature. 

Also I strong recommend this another [intro video](https://youtu.be/87oOF9Ve-KA?si=abSS61SqFY_gp7K1) by Tim Corei, he has been doing a great job teaching C# and Microsoft stack in general so take a look on his youtube channel too.

# Keep going

As we're facing new chalanges on the project I will be updating the Readme with content to help us understand the available features on the framework.
